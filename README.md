# Nightreign Overlay — Seed Finder + In‑Game Overlay

An Electron-based **seed finder** and **overlay** for *Elden Ring Nightreign*. It lets you quickly narrow seeds/patterns and renders labels on top of the game’s map.
Forked from shahf215/Nightreign-Overlay

## Highlights

- 🔎 **Seed Finder**: fast pruning with slot icons (Spawn / Churches / Sorcerer’s Rise / Township, etc.), per‑slot pickers, and smart “ghost” hints when only two options remain.
- 🗺️ **Overlay**: transparent, always‑on‑top; category toggles, per‑category colors, font size / scale, global offset.
- 🎮 **Controller support**: DualSense **and** Xbox .
- ⌨️ **Hotkeys**: F7–F10 by default, fully customizable (UI or `config/hotkeys.json`).
- 🌐 **Languages**: UI and Label translations available in العربية, English, Español, 日本語, 한국어, Polski, Português, Русский, 中文.
- 🔒 **Safe with EAC**: never touches the game process; just keyboard/gamepad input and an overlay window.
- 🧩 **Deep of the Night mode friendly**: when POIs are hidden in‑game, you can still identify the seed by placing your **Spawn** and other early visibile icons.

## Quick Start (Developer Mode)
- Ideal for debugging and UI tweaks
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## 🚀 Build a Windows .exe
- Produces a directory that contains an executable and it's dependencies.
- Output goes to `dist/win-unpacked`
```bash
npm install   # skip if already installed
npm run dist:win
```

## 🚀 Build a Windows .exe (Portable but slower)
- Produces a single-file executable you can copy anywhere and run.
- Output goes to `dist/`

npm install   # skip if already installed
npm run dist:dir
```

## Using Seed Finder

1. **Open Seed Finder** and bring it into focus (F7) and choose a **Shifting Earth** type (you can click the buttons in the side bar or the thumbnails).
2. Click icons on the map to **pick per‑slot** values (Spawn, Churches, Township, etc.).  
   - The slot picker appears on click; unavailable/invalid options are hidden.  
   - If the logic narrows to two options and one is empty, you’ll see a **ghost icon** on the map as a hint.
3. Continue placing icons until the **candidate count** converges.
4. When one seed is left it will automatically display.

### Deep of the Night (hidden POIs)
When the game hides POIs, you can still narrow the seed by setting **Spawn** (in cases where you spawn at a church use the **Church Spawn** combined icon). Supplement with other early POIs to narrow down your seed.

---

### POI Settings (visibility + color)
In **Seed Finder → Overlay Options → POI Settings** you can toggle categories and pick colors:
- Night Bosses, Evergaol, Field Boss, Events, Sorcerer’s Rise, Castle, Ruins, Great Churches, Churches, Townships, Forts, Camps, Caravans.

Each category has an independent color swatch.

### Overlay Settings
Also under **Overlay Options**:
- **Font Size** — label font size.  
- **Offset X / Offset Y** — nudges every label.  
- **Scale** — scales label size and paddings.

> All settings persist on restart.

## Troubleshooting

- **Overlay doesn’t appear**  
  - If you have multiple monitors, the overlay attaches to your **primary display**. Move the game window there or change the primary monitor.
- **Hotkey doesn’t work**  
  - Another app may have registered that shortcut. Change your hotkey in **Hotkey Settings**.
- **Controller toggle doesn’t work**  
  - Disable or reconfigure **Steam Input** so the pad reports standard buttons.
- **Wrong language/labels**  
  - Switch language in the Finder dropdown.

---

## Safety

- Runs as a normal desktop app.  
- No game memory reads/writes, no DLL injection, no kernel drivers.  
- Safe to use with **Easy Anti‑Cheat enabled**.
- Still use at your own risk.
